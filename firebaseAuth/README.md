# FirebaseAuth

###### IMPORTANT
Must add your own creds for firebase via. a Globals/api-creds.ts file in the root of the application.

## Basic Application written in Angular4 leveraging firebase for basic authentication security practices w/ firebase. Almost was a test to see how I would compare authentication with firebase compared to my own backend server API. Firebase seems to have powerful functionality for smaller scale projects that want a quick release proccess. 

### !!!This appp only works if you add in your own firebase api key in a folder namer globals/api_creds.ts at the root of the app
